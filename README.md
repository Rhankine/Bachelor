# D3_Charts

This is the code for my bachelor project. I do investigation into peoples perception of data, when given the possibility to interact with chart data.

Code is greatly inspired by Mike Bostock, who was cofounder of D3.js.
Check out his website https://bost.ocks.org/mike/ or his work on GitHub https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery, he do have some awesome work with visualization and interaction.
